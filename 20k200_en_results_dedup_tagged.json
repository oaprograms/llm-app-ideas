Imagine a standard electrical circuit breaker: if too much current flows (too many errors occur in the function), the breaker trips. This software wraps your existing function. If the function starts failing repeatedly due to errors or timeouts (indicating a potential hang or dependency issue), the Circuit Breaker automatically stops all new calls to that function for a short period. This prevents threads from piling up or continuously retrying the failing operation, effectively isolating the problem and preventing a system-wide crash or hang, thus improving overall resilience.","tags":["AI/ML","Code Generation","Automation","Engineering"],"score":8,"devLen":"1 TO 2 MONTHS","numUsers":"1 thousand or less","isNew":"existing app","userNeed_sr":"Korisnik želi da razume kako da postojeću Python 3.8 funkciju učini sigurnom za niti i otpornom na greške kako bi se sprečilo zamrzavanje ili rušenje programa.","llmCanDoIt":"LIKELY"},{"softwareName":"Nutri-Diagnostic Goal Setter (NDGS)","userNeed":"The user wants a one-month nutrition plan and menu to lose 10 kg, tailored to their age, weight, and height, with the understanding that a nutritionist might ask clarifying questions.","description":"This software is a 'Smart Nutritional Calculator' combined with a 'Diagnostic Prompt Generator.'

The operational effectiveness of construction projects is directly correlated with the speed and accuracy of quality assurance processes. Traditional methods relying on paper forms introduce significant lag and potential for data entry errors, which impede timely corrective action. The implementation of automated, real-time data capture systems is therefore essential for optimizing compliance and minimizing rework cycles. This need is addressed by a simple yet innovative digital tool. This software acts as a smart, mobile checklist that runs on a standard phone or tablet. It translates complex architectural blueprints and technical specifications into easily understandable, sequential steps for the workers in the field. As a construction task is completed, the worker uses the app to log required measurements and capture geotagged photos. The software immediately analyzes this input, comparing the field data against the project's mandated standards (such as required dimensions or material tolerances). This automated verification ensures instantaneous quality control, allowing project managers to confirm compliance or identify deviations without delay, thereby maintaining strict adherence to contractual requirements.","tags":["Legal Tech","Compliance","Automation","Engineering"],"score":7,"devLen":"1 TO 2 MONTHS","numUsers":"1 thousand or less","isNew":"new app idea","userNeed_sr":"Korisnik želi naučne i objektivne zaključke iz trećeg lica, počevši sa specifičnom frazom o kontroli dnevnog napretka, merenjima, zahtevima i verifikaciji građevinskih elemenata.","llmCanDoIt":"LIKELY"},{"softwareName":"The Growth-Stability Spectrum Optimizer","userNeed":"The user wants an optimized Indian mutual fund portfolio with medium risk and a 3-year tenure, including healthcare and international funds, aiming for higher returns with lower risk and volatility.","description":"This software, \"The Risk-Return Tuner,\" is like a smart dashboard for your investments.

This robot sits between you and ChatGPT. It holds all the specific, complex rules and keeps track of everyone’s character sheets (health, inventory, stats). Whenever ChatGPT tries to describe an action or calculate a dice roll, the Rules Robot intercepts it, enforces the rules precisely, updates the character data, and then feeds the verified outcome back to ChatGPT. This stops ChatGPT from forgetting rules or making math errors, letting it focus only on the narrative and world-building.","tags":["AI/ML","LLM","Code Generation","Automation","Gaming","Gaming","Content Creation","Personalized Advice"],"score":6.5,"devLen":"2 TO 3 MONTHS","numUsers":"1 thousand or less","isNew":"new app idea","userNeed_sr":"Korisnik želi da igra tekstualnu društvenu igru uloga gde ChatGPT deluje kao voditelj igre, prateći specifična, iako nepotpuna, pravila.","llmCanDoIt":"SOMEWHAT LIKELY"},{"softwareName":"Chronological Precision Auditor","userNeed":"The user wants to verify if dates and times in a summary precisely match those in a provided document.","description":"This software, often called a 'Temporal Entity Checker,' scans both the original document and the summary.
